System info
===========

hetzner is an arm64 virtual machine on an Heztner Ampere Altra host in
Falkenstein, with 2 vCPUs, 4G RAM, 40G virtio scsi disk and virtio network.

The disk is GPT partitioned with a 512M vfat /boot, and the kernel is booted
directly from /boot/efi/boot/bootaa64.efi by the UEFI BIOS. The command line

  console=tty0 loglevel=2 root=PARTLABEL=root

is compiled into the kernel as boot entries cannot be configured manually.

It is possible to netboot the VM from a Debian recovery image from the
web interface at https://console.hetzner.cloud/ - this can be used for
initial installation and emergency maintenance.

To cross-compile the kernel, use

  make -C linux ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-musl-

We use an ext4 root filesystem, with 1G zram swap to limit SSD wear.


Partitioning and filesystems
----------------------------

Create the GPT label and partitions:

  sfdisk /dev/sda <<< 'label: gpt'
  sfdisk -a /dev/sda <<< 'size=512M, type=uefi, name=boot'
  sfdisk -a /dev/sda <<< 'size=+, type=linux, name=root'

Make the boot and root filesystems:

  mkfs.vfat -n boot /dev/sda1
  mkfs.ext4 -L root -O project,quota /dev/sda2

Copy the kernel from linux/arch/arm64/boot/Image to both /boot/linux.efi
and /boot/efi/boot/bootaa64.efi so the hypervisor BIOS will automatically
boot from it.
